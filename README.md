# EasyChair Scripts

This repository includes a number of simple Python scripts a PC chair of a large conference might use to analyse and manipulate data downloaded from [EasyChair](https://easychair.org/). I wrote them when I was PC chair of [ECAI-2024](https://www.ecai2024.eu/), the 27th European Conference of Artificial Intelligence (a conference with over 2,300 paper submissions). They are provided here in the hope that others might find them useful.

For more ambitious development projects to build tools for conference management, you might instead want to instead take the [EasyChair-Extra](https://github.com/COMSOC-Community/easychair-extra) package developed by Simon Rey as a starting point.
